                        <p>I was born in New York state and moved to Philly in 1983. My first computer was a 128k
                            Mac
                            which
                            my
                            father brought home from work that year. I have always been interested in computers and
                            electronics
                            and the tools involved. I always want to know how things work behind the scenes.</p>
                        <p>I am very much into all genres of music. I am mostly interested in instrumental music
                            like
                            jam
                            bands
                            and jazz. I play guitar, drums, keyboards and a little bass but mostly I play guitar. I
                            like
                            to
                            learn how to play classics as well as create my own songs.</p>
                        <p>I am very excited to learn and work with new technologies such as NodeJS and React. I
                            like to
                            learn new languages, frameworks and design patterns. </p>
                        <p>I am also a huge fan of comedy. In fact my favorite movies are comedies. Other genres
                            include
                            movies about real history or biographies of famous people. My favorite comediennes are
                            Larry
                            David, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis C.K.</p>
